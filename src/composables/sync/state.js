/**
 * @file composables/sync/state.js
 * @description Shared singleton state for the Directus sync subsystem.
 *
 * All module-level mutable variables from useDirectusSync.js are centralised
 * here as properties of a single `syncState` object. Exporting a shared object
 * (rather than separate mutable primitives) is critical: ES-module imports are
 * live bindings, but imported bindings are read-only in the importing module.
 * That means exporting `_pushGeneration` as a standalone primitive would not
 * let other modules coordinate updates to it without additional setter APIs.
 * By keeping mutable state on a shared object, `syncState._pushGeneration++`
 * in any module updates the same singleton state observed by all importers.
 *
 * Risk 5 from the refactor plan: "primitives imported as
 * `import { _pushGeneration }` would not reflect post-import mutations."
 *
 * Extracted from useDirectusSync.js (§5.7 refactor).
